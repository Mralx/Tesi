Collaborative Multi-Robot Exploration

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper is considered the problem of exploring an unknown environment
 by a team of robot.
 The main focus is on the coordination of a team of multiple robots by the
 definition of target points for the exploration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mainly two previous approaches concerning multiple robots exploration are
 presented.
 First one consists in separating the environment into stripes and then
 explore them by moving just one robot and keeping the other stationary.
 This reduces odometry error but robots are forced to stay close to each
 other.
 Second one considers the use of a common map built as the exploration goes
 on and as a robot discovers an opening to an unexplored area, which can't
 reach due to its size, it chooses another robot to achieve this task.
 The selection is performed taking into account the number of areas to explore,
 size of the robot and the distance of the robot and the target location.
 This approach moves robots to the closest unexplored frontier but neither
 provide a coordination mechanism to avoid the selection of the same frontier
 by multiple robots nor it uses an accurate distance measure, using straight
 line distance rather than a computation on the current map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach presented in this paper uses occupancy grid maps to represent
 the environment and assumes robots to know their relative position during
 the whole exploration process.
 This assumption is useful to allow a simple computation of the integrated
 occupancy grid map.
 The selection of target points to explore is based on two concepts: the
 cost of reaching it and the utility it provides.
 Cost for traversing a cell is proportional to the occupancy value of that
 cell and through that definition, the minimum cost path between two cells
 can be computed.
 The utility of a target point is calculated as the expected visible area
 from that point.
 To find out this value, it exploits an heuristic based on the observation
 that a robot exploring a big open terrain can cover much larger areas than
 a robot exploring a narrow part of the environment.
 This is achieved by counting the number of times 
\begin_inset Formula $h(d_{i})$
\end_inset

 the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 was measured by any of the robots.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(d_{i})$
\end_inset

 is then used to compute the probability that the robot's sensors covers
 objects at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 A great advantage of the algorithm introduced is that two robots never
 choose the same target point because once a robot is assigned to it, utility
 of that point is decreased accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The provided experimental results only deal with an office-like environment
 and show that the coordination always provides better performances.
 Moreover, two coordinated robots have performances similar to three uncoordinat
ed robots and the improvement introduced by the coordination is almost the
 same both with two and three robots.

Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - Burgard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the previous paper, the focus of this one is on the coordination of
 a team of multiple robots by the definition of target points for the exploratio
n, but it also takes into account limited communication among them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm used for the assignment of the target points is almost the
 same as above.
 Few differences are introduced in the reduction of the utility of a frontier
 cell after a robot is assigned to an adjacent one and in determining the
 pair robot-frontier cell.
 In fact, in the previous case, cost and utility had the same weight, now
 the relative importance of utility versus cost is modified through a positive
 factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, experiments performed, showed that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\in[0.01,50]$
\end_inset

 the exploration time is almost constant.
 While if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>50$
\end_inset

 the impact of the coordination decreases, thus the exploration time increases.
 While if it is near 0, robots ignore distance to be traveled, increasing
 again the exploration time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Limited communication range affects highly the algorithm explained before,
 but it is easily modified to deal with this problem by applying it to every
 sub-team of robots which are able to communicate with each other.
 Another issue derived from the limited communication consists in when new
 assignments have to be computed.
 In fact, in the case of perfect communication, they can be calculated whenever
 a robot reaches its target.
 In the other case, this approach can't be pursued.
 Therefore, what is done is to store in each robot the latest target locations
 assigned to other robots; in this way, robots avoid going to places already
 explored by other robots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is meaningful to point out that to achieve coordination, the team must
 be able to communicate the maps of the individual robots during exploration.
