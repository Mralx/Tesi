Collaborative Multi-Robot Exploration

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper is considered the problem of exploring an unknown environment
 by a team of robot.
 The main focus is on the coordination of a team of multiple robots by the
 definition of target points for the exploration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of multiple coordinated robots is motivated by the increased efficiency
 in accomplishing this task, rather than a single robot.
 Same holds for the localization of the robots in the environment because
 they can exhange information about their positions as they sense each other.
 Using multiple robots also allows them to be cheaper with respect to one
 which should perform the exploration by itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mainly two previous approaches concerning multiple robots exploration are
 presented.
 First one consists in separating the environment into stripes and then
 explore them by moving just one robot and keeping the other stationary.
 This reduces odometry error but robots are forced to stay close to each
 other.
 Second one considers the use of a common map built as the exploration goes
 on and as a robot discovers an opening to an unexplored area, which can't
 reach due to its size, it chooses another robot to achieve this task.
 The selection is performed taking into account the number of areas to explore,
 size of the robot and the distance of the robot and the target location.
 This approach moves robots to the closest unexplored frontier but neither
 provide a coordination mechanism to avoid the selection of the same frontier
 by multiple robots nor it uses an accurate distance measure, using straight
 line distance rather than a computation on the current map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach presented in this paper uses occupancy grid maps to represent
 the environment and assumes robots to know their relative position during
 the whole exploration process.
 This assumption is useful to allow a simple computation of the integrated
 occupancy grid map.
 The selection of target points to explore is based on two concepts: the
 cost of reaching it and the utility it provides.
 Cost for traversing a cell is proportional to the occupancy value of that
 cell and through that definition, the minimum cost path between two cells
 can be computed.
 The utility of a target point is calculated as the expected visible area
 from that point.
 To find out this value, it exploits an heuristic based on the observation
 that a robot exploring a big open terrain can cover much larger areas than
 a robot exploring a narrow part of the environment.
 This is achieved by counting the number of times 
\begin_inset Formula $h(d_{i})$
\end_inset

 the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 was measured by any of the robots.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(d_{i})$
\end_inset

 is then used to compute the probability that the robot's sensors covers
 objects at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 A great advantage of the algorithm introduced is that two robots never
 choose the same target point because once a robot is assigned to it, utility
 of that point is decreased accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The provided experimental results only deal with an office-like environment
 and show that the coordination always provides better performances.
 Moreover, two coordinated robots have performances similar to three uncoordinat
ed robots and the improvement introduced by the coordination is almost the
 same both with two and three robots.
