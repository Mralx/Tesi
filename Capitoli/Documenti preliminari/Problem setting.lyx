\begin_layout Title
Problem setting and definitions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem we address deals with a team of robots exploring an environment
 initially unknown.
 The aim of this work is to find out if some features of the environment
 can be exploited in order to improve the exploration performances.
 This exploration problem can be formally defined through a 4-ple ⟨
\begin_inset Formula $A,E,P_{0},T$
\end_inset

⟩ where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the set of robots used for the exploration;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the environment to explore;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $P_{0}$
\end_inset

is a vector of the initial poses of the team;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the termination criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This four elements characterize the instance of exploration problem we are
 addressing, while the solution of the problem consists in producing a map
 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 of the environment 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 The map 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 consists in a 2D occupancy grid representing the areas of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 The center of each cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is characterized by its coordinates in the environment, provided as a vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{c},y_{c})$
\end_inset

.
 Each cell contains a variable, whose value tells if that cell is clear,
 occupied by an obstacle or still unexplored.
 Clearly, the first two values refer only to already explored cells, while
 the third refers to those cells which are still not mapped by any robot
 of the team.
 In particular, a cell is clear if there are no obstacles in it, otherwise,
 it is occupied.
 As stated above, the aim of this work is to find out if it exists a correlation
 between a set of features of the environment and a possible improvement
 in the exploration performance.
 The features taken into account are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dimension: small environments will take less to be explored with respect
 to large ones 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Openness: the property of an environment to be composed of large spaces
 rather than cluttered ones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Parallelizability: a measure of how much the robots are enforced to spread
 during the exploration or if they will stick together
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being the environment unknown, we cannot use it directly to extract these
 features.
 Thus, we need to use the map produced by the robots for teh computation
 and this feature extraction step should be done as the exploration goes
 on; in this way, we can update the coordination strategy online.
 For this reason, we define as 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{t}$
\end_inset

 the map known at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[t_{0},t_{f}]$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the time at which the exploration starts and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{f}$
\end_inset

 is the time at which the exploration ends, i.e.
 the time at which the termination criteria 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is verified.
 We also define the auxiliary function 
\begin_inset Formula $S:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 which takes as input a cell of the map and provides its area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dimension and openness computation can be easily defined being rather intuitive
 features of an environment.
 On the other hand, parallelizability needs further considerations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dimension can be computed as the amount of free area in the map, thus it
 is the sum of the area of all the clear cells: 
\begin_inset Formula $D(M)=\sum_{i}S(f_{i})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}$
\end_inset

 being a clear cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Openness is related to the obstacle density, so to the probability of a
 randomly picked cell to be occupied by an obstacle: 
\begin_inset Formula $O(M)=\frac{\Sigma_{i}S(o_{i})}{\Sigma_{j}S(c_{j})}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $o_{i}$
\end_inset

 is an occupied cell and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a generic cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before moving to parallelizability, we need to introduce the notion of embedded
 graph.
 A graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 embedded to a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is a representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 such that points of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and simple arcs in it are associated with vertices and edges of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 In the case we are analyzing, this concept can be exploited by creating
 a graph 
\begin_inset Formula $\varUpsilon$
\end_inset

 embedded on the map 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and then through the concept of centrality of a node, we can find out what
 are the most important nodes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varUpsilon$
\end_inset

.
 On this setting, we can define the parallelizability according to the number
 of central nodes in the graph and on the average number of connections
 of each node.
 The measures of centrality of a node which might represent an interesting
 metric in this particular case are: degree, closeness, and betweenness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Degree centrality is equal to the number of links incident to a node and
 in our case, this could be used to count the number of unexplored adjacent
 nodes.
 It would be of particular interest to count the number of frontiers adjacent
 to a certain node because in such a case, that node is very likely to be
 a splitting point for the team.
 This is the only centrality measure which can be exploited at any point
 of the exploration, i.e.
 as the map and consequently, the graph are still not complete.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closeness centrality is equal to the average length of the shortest path
 between the node and all the other nodes in the graph.
 While betweenness quantifies the number of times a node is along the shortest
 path between two other nodes.
 This two measure can be computed even if the map is not completed yet,
 but doing so, their value may change as the exploration goes on.
 This does not hold for what concerns the degree centrality measure for
 a non-frontier node.
 However, they can be useful for an a posteriori analysis of the produced
 map.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For what concerns centrality measures, another metric can be taken into
 account, that is the cross-clique centrality because it determines the
 connectivity of a node to different cliques.
 A clique is a subset of the nodes of an undirected graph such that every
 two distinct nodes in the clique are adjacent.
 This means that they are subgraphs in which every node is connected to
 every other node in the clique.
 The cross-clique centrality could be used as closeness and betweenness
 in an a posteriori analysis and eventually to find out properties which
 could be exploited.
