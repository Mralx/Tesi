Exploration problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exploration problem can be defined as the problem of mapping an unknown environment by means of a team of robots. Thus, the objective is the construction of a map of the environment but this introduces further problems, concerning for example the localization of each robot dealing with the various sources of uncertainty, how to distribute the team, and how to coordinate them. These are three of the main aspects considered in the development of a solution to this problem, providing the major impact on performance. To compare different approaches the main metric used is the time taken by the exploration

This four elements characterize the instance of EP addressed, while the solution of the same consists in producing a map

\end_inset

 of the environment 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

. To do this, each robot is able to perceive the environment through one or more sensors, characterized by the size of the spanned area. The map 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 consists in a 2D occupancy grid representing the areas of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

. The center of each cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is characterized by its coordinates in a global coordinate system, provided as a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{c},y_{c})$
\end_inset

. Each cell contains a value which tells if that cell is free, occupied by an obstacle, or still unknown. Clearly, the first two values refer only to already explored cells, while the third value refers to those cells which are still not scanned by any robot of the team.

\begin_layout Section
Localization and mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of mapping an unknown environment and simultaneously localize a single robot on the partial map built is one of the fundamental problems of robotics, called 
\emph on
SLAM problem,
\emph default
 from 
\emph on
Simultaneous Localization And Mapping. 
\emph default
The robot knows its initial pose and, as it moves, the uncertainty about its pose increases, due to uncertainty in the odometry. For this reason it becomes necessary to localize the robot on the map, even a partial one. A formal description of it, as provided in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

key "Thrun2008"

\end_inset

, is suitably done in a probabilistic framework and distinguishes two versions, the 
\emph on
online 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
full
\emph default
 
\emph on
SLAM problem
\emph default
. Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{T},U_{T}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{T}$
\end_inset

 be three statistical variables representing respectively the sequence of poses assumed by the robot, i.e., the 
\emph on
path
\emph default
, the sequence of odometry measurements, and the sequence of measurements provided by the sensors. Let also 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 be the true map of the environment. The 
\emph on
full SLAM problem 
\emph default
is then defined as the problem of estimating the posterior probability of the map together with the whole path traveled by the robot, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(X_{T},m|Z_{T},U_{T}\right)$
\end_inset

. The 
\emph on
online SLAM problem 
\emph default
aims at estimating the posterior of the actual location of the robot, rather than the whole path, together with the map. Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x_{T},m|Z_{T},U_{T}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens in practice is that as the robot moves in an unknown environment, it perceives the surroundings through its sensors, has an estimate of its pose from its odometry measures and these are used to reduce the uncertainty both about the map built and the location of, or the path followed by, the robot, depending on the version of the SLAM algorithm implemented. As the exploration goes on, the partial map approaches to a complete map of the environment and it is also possible to get rid of the noise in the measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model used for the map can be both topological

 or metric

. In particular in this thesis, the representation provided as output by the SLAM algorithm is metric, consisting of an occupancy grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work considers only indoor environments. Reasons behind this restriction are related to the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

key "Cattaneo2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, of which this thesis is an extension, in order to provide a comparison in the same type of environments. Moreover, this focus is justified by the application contexts, being the exploration of indoor environments more common with respect to outdoor ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The representation of the map provided by the SLAM algorithm used in this work is a two-dimensional occupancy grid. Moreover, being applied to a multi-robot scenario, it comes out the difficulty of merging the maps computed by solving the SLAM problem for each agent. The solution to this is a centralized approach by means of a base station, which collects all the individual local maps and combines them into a single global map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after ""
key "Cattaneo2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the environments are classified according to some features characterizing them. In particular, the aspects considered are the size, the openness, and the parallelizability. The first two are easy to formally define. For the third one, a formal definition can hardly be provided being influenced by many factors. To make the definitions more readable, recalling that 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 denotes the map of the environment modeled as an occupancy grid, let 
\begin_inset Formula $S:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 be an auxiliary function which takes as input a cell of the map and provides its area. The features considered can be defined in the following way. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Size: the amount of free area in the map. Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $D(M)=\sum_{i}S(f_{i})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}$
\end_inset

 being a free cell. The size of the environment clearly affects the average time taken by robots to explore it. The smaller the environment, the lower the amount of resources needed to map it. From this, the distinction into small (S) and large (L) environments. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Openness: the property of an environment to be composed of large open spaces (O) rather than cluttered ones (C). It is related to obstacle density, so to the probability of a randomly picked cell to be occupied by an obstacle. This is formally defined in a probabilistic framework as 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(M\right)=\frac{\sum_{i}S(o_{i})}{\sum_{j}S(c_{j})}$
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $o_{i}$
\end_inset

 is an occupied cell and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a generic cell. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Parallelizability: the property of an environment to enforce the spreading of the robots during the exploration. A formal definition to this is hard to provide, but it can be informally presented considering that if the environment allows the team to spread, it is highly parallelizable (HP). Otherwise, if the robots are forced to stick together, it is lightly parallelizable (LP). 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make these distinctions clearer, it is worth looking at some of the environments used in this work and at how they are classified according to these features. In Figure 1, two very different environments are presented.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The environment in Figure 1.a is composed of a series of large corridors, ending in some rooms. This is classified as S-O-LP, because its dimension is small and the areas of which it is composed are mainly open ones, not cluttered rooms. The lightly parallelizability comes out from its configuration, where the robots follow almost similar paths, forced by the long corridors and they are not allowed to spread into it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second one (Figure 1.b) is likely to be the map of an office. It is composed of a lot of rooms, corridors and spaces with different sizes. It is classified as L-C-HP because the amount of free area is really large and is mainly composed of rooms and limited spaces. For the configuration of the corridors, the robots tend to spread in different directions, without sticking close to each other. For this reason, the environment is classified as highly parallelizable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In MRESim, an agent is characterized through: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a number and an ID to uniquely identify it; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
its pose, expressed by a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\left[x,y,\phi\right]$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 are the coordinates of the grid cells occupied by the robot and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is its orientation; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the sensing range, set to the default value; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the communication range, assumed to be infinite; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the battery life, assumed to be infinite as well; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
its type, it can be the base station, a relay, or an explorer. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The communication range and the battery life are assumed to be infinite because the focus of this work is on the results provided by the use of different coordination mechanisms. In this way, it is possible to simplify the mechanisms not to consider scenarios in which the robots run out of fuel or they are unable to communicate, even if these situations are of particular interest in a more realistic context and object of study as in

 and

, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stated above, the type of the robot, not to be confused with its role, can be: base station, relay, or explorer. The 
\emph on
relay
\emph default
 type is never used in the simulations performed for this work, being useful in cases in which communication between a robot and the base station is not possible using a direct link. Indeed, each team used is composed of one base station and from two to eleven explorers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
base station
\emph default
 is the central coordinator of the team and stores the global map computed by merging the partial maps provided by the agents. It is configured similarly to other agents but its pose is fixed to the initial one. It is important for the purpose of exploration because allows agents to coordinate by means of a centralized unit, rather than a decentralized approach, which would make the merging of the map way more difficult. An example of a decentralized approach is in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

key "Benedettelli2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, where only as soon as two robots meet, they are able to merge their maps and then proceed with the exploration based on this updated map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
explorer 
\emph default
is the main kind of agents employed, being the one which moves in the environment to map it. Apart from the configuration parameters presented above, it is also characterized by a finite speed. Explorer are equipped with a laser range sensor allowing them to scan a semicircle of radius equal to the sensing range in front of them. The value for the sensing range is specified in the configuration file. As an explorer perceives previously unknown cells with its laser sensor, it communicates the measurements to the base station which merges them with the current map and updates it. The updated map is then sent to each agent.

\begin_layout Standard
The frontier-based exploration presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is applied to identify the candidate locations to explore. A frontier is the boundary region between known and unknown space and by moving towards frontiers, this boundary is pushed forward accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As highlighted in the previous section, the model for the map is an occupancy grid. Each robot has its own local map, updated through the sensor measurements, and merged at the base station to provide a global map, which is the one used in the frontiers identification phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frontiers are identified by at first drawing the contour of the known space. The contour, represented by the pink line in Figure 2, depicts a clear distinction between the known space, the yellow one, and unknown space, the gray one. Then, the contour is split into smaller segments such that each segment is included within two obstacles. Due to the representation based on occupancy grids, segments are composed of a series of cells, whose centers are used as vertices of a polygon. If the area of this polygon is higher than a certain threshold, then the cell located at its barycenter is a frontier. In the figure, the three identified frontiers are indicated with the little squares. The presence of two frontiers in the room on the right is due to the obstacle in the middle of that room, which splits the contour into two segments. Another aspect to notice is that the lower frontier on the right is located in the middle of the known space, not on the border, and this is due to the shape of the polygon, being it convex.

Coordination mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A coordination mechanism is the algorithm providing the allocation of robots to the possible frontiers computed by the exploration strategy. Together with the SLAM algorithm and the exploration strategy, this completes the view on the system needed for the exploration. In fact, the process of exploring an unknown environment starts with the robots scanning an area through their sensors and these data, together with the initial locations, are used as input to the SLAM algorithm, which provides a partial map as output. This is given to the exploration strategy that, as stated above, performs a discretization of the polygon enclosing the known area and computes the frontiers, excluding the ones too small. At this point, the coordination mechanism is applied to find out an allocation of robots to frontiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordination mechanisms are the main focus of this work. In the following, the coordination mechanisms we consider are presented both as the base mechanisms from

 They are all focused on how

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a snapshot of the exploration just after the one of Figure 2. Five frontiers are detected: one located between the robots G and H, one in the central corridor and three on the right. To each one is assigned a robot, except for the three on the right. Being the distance among them within a certain clustering threshold, only a robot is turned into active and assigned to the nearest one. Thus, a total of three robots is turned into active, depicted in purple in the figure, and assigned to a frontier, while the remaining five robots compose the idle set, depicted in blue.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The policy for the active set is the same for all the mechanisms, to explore the closest frontier. The differences come out dealing with the idle set, in fact the way in which robots are proactively moved allows to distinguish among each method. Moreover, this theme of a proactive use of the idle set is the leitmotiv linking the work started in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and extended both by

 and this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reserve is the less proactive mechanism because as the name implies, each robot composing the idle set is left as a reserve at its initial location. As the exploration starts and the first frontiers are detected, the robots are split into the active set and the idle set, in a similar way to the example provided before. Then, the robots in the active set move towards their assigned frontiers and the ones in the idle set remain still in their initial positions. As the exploration goes on and new frontiers are found, their number may be higher than the size of the active set, making some or all the robots from the idle set needed, which are then turned into active and assigned to a frontier. Once the idle set is empty and all the robots are active, the exploration proceeds in an uncoordinated way. This means that each robot is assigned to the closest frontier, without taking into account whether another robot has been already assigned to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Divide and conquer is the most proactive mechanism presented in that work because the idle set moves together with the active set. At the beginning of the exploration, active agents are assigned to the frontiers and the idle set is split in several subsets, one for each active agent. For example, assume that at the beginning, only a frontier is found. Then, an agent is marked as 
\emph on
leader 
\emph default
and assigned to explore it. The other robots follow it as it moves towards its frontier, until at least another frontier is detected. For the sake of the example, assume that at this point there are two frontiers. In this case, a robot from the idle set is turned into active and marked as leader. The idle set is split in two: one half follows the first leader, the other half follows the other one. This goes on until the idle set is empty, after which the exploration proceeds in an uncoordinated way. Differently from the reserve mechanism, this approach allows to have robots from the idle set nearer to the frontier to which they are going to be assigned. In this sense, the idle team members are considered to be more proactive with respect to reserve, where waiting at the initial location makes the distance between the robot turned into active and the assigned frontier higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buddy system is considered to be halfway between the two previous mechanisms for what concerns proactivity of the agents. This comes clearer by looking at how the mechanism handles the idle set. As soon as robots are deployed on the environment, pairs are formed, composed of a robot marked as 
\emph on
leader
\emph default
 and another marked as 
\emph on
follower
\emph default
, each one is the 
\emph on
buddy
\emph default
 of the other. Once frontiers are identified, the minimum number of leader agents is turned into active and assigned to them. Each follower follows its own leader towards the assigned frontier. The other pairs remain still at the initial location, similarly to the idle set in the reserve mechanism. When a branching point is met, that is a point where there are two or more frontiers, the pair is split and the leader is assigned to a frontier, while the follower to the other one. Here, the analogy with the divide and conquer mechanism can be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of this situation is shown in Figure 3. The orange pair is going towards the assigned frontier highlighted by the red dot in Figure 3.a. As this is reached (Figure 3.b), being the number of frontiers high, the orange pair is split, assigning to each robot the closest frontier. These are represented as a green dot for the robot which previously was the follower, and as a pink one for the leader (Figure 3.c). At this point, each robot goes towards its own frontier (Figure 3.d).

\begin_layout Standard
If a robot split from its buddy finds another branching point, a couple from the idle set is called and assigned to one of the two frontiers, while the single robot goes towards the other. This clarifies why the buddy system can be seen as a mix of the reserve mechanism and the divide and conquer mechanism. It both keeps the idle set waiting at the initial location until the moment at which it is needed, as reserve, and each leader goes with a follower from which splits when a branching point is met, similarly to divide and conquer. In this way, when a follower is turned into active, it is already pretty near to its frontier, providing a similar advantage of divide and conquer, without the disadvantage of having the whole team moving close.

 are introduced. As stated previously, they focus on enhancing the proactivity of the idle set. The way in which this is done is pretty straightforward for what concerns reserve and buddy system, while it is a little more tricky for divide and conquer. The mechanisms proposed are named

\begin_layout Standard
The main problem with reserve mechanism is that, once a robot from the idle set is turned into active, it has to move from the initial location to its assigned frontier. The distance it has to travel may be lower if the robot is moved to a nearer position while it is still idle. This is exactly what this modified mechanism tries to do by moving the idle robots to the barycenter of the polygon whose vertices are active robots positions. In this way, they are likely to be nearer to the newly detected frontiers which have to be explored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The buddy system faces a similar problem as the reserve mechanism: the robots in the idle set wait to be turned into active at the initial location. Thus, the proactive version of the buddy system moves the idle pairs at the barycenter of the polygon formed by the active agents locations, for the same reason explained above concerning the proactive reserve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of divide and conquer is different, being related to the interference caused by moving the whole team of robots together. Therefore, the team of robots is split into groups of three at the beginning of the exploration and roles are assigned to them. The central robot is the leader, the right one is the right follower and the left one is the left follower. These roles are statically determined and never modified. Moreover, they affect the assignment of frontiers to the group members, being the frontiers along the direction of the movement assigned to the leader, the ones on its right assigned to the right follower and the ones on the left to the left follower symmetrically. In this way, there is a trade-off between the interference caused by the number of robots moving together and the distance from the frontiers, reducing the first one without affecting too much the second one.
