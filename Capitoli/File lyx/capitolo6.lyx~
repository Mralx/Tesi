Proactive Buddy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of steps needed by the proactive buddy mechanism for each configurati
on of graphs and centrality measures for the first environment are depicted
 in Figure x.
 This is a low parallelizable environment and this can be noticed by looking
 that even increasing the number of robots deployed, the exploration steps
 reach a plateau, remaining almost equal for a team composed from seven
 robots to ten.
 In general, no mechanism seems to constantly outperform the others, but
 except for two cases, the benchmark mechanism exploiting the barycenter
 requires more steps to complete the exploration.
 Moreover, the number of steps required by the mechanism based on the betweennes
s of the topological graph tends to monotonically decrease, while the others
 have alternating trend.

The second environment is the simple maze.
 Due to its structure, robots are forced to follow a single path and all
 the runs provide similar result (Figure 2).
 It is interesting to notice how the methods using the visibility graph
 perform almost the same for each team configuration.
 In this case, the proactivity based on the barycenter seems to provide
 the best results in general.

The third environment is characterized by a central corridor with rooms
 on the sides and it is the first open environment considered up to this
 point.
 Looking at Figure 3, there can be found two groups of team sizes performing
 almost the same.
 In fact, teams composed of five, seven and eight robots have almost the
 same performance.
 The same holds for the teams composed of nine to eleven robots.
 This is a peculiar pattern which is probably caused by the structure of
 the environment.
 In general, mechanisms based on closeness seem to perform better than the
 others, even if the mechanism exploiting the barycenter provides almost
 the best performance.

The forth environment is the most open one, being composed of a large room
 and a smaller one.
 In this one, the steps needed by each mechanism have varying trends according
 to the team size.
 Similarly to the first environment, the proactive buddy using the barycenter
 performs worse than at least another mechanism, except for two team sizes.
 In particular, with teams composed from eight to eleven robots, the mechanism
 computing betweenness for the topological graph takes less to explore.
 Another interesting pattern is that for small teams of four and five robots,
 mechanisms based on closeness perform better than the one based on the
 betweenness of the same graph.
 This trend holds up to teams of eight robots for the visibility graph.
 Then, as the size of the team increases, the trend inverts, making the
 mechanisms based on betweenness outperform the ones utilizing closeness,
 for both the graphs.

The fifth environment is the most complex one.
 The proactive buddy is characterized by an alternated trend with odd teams
 providing in general better performance, except when composed of five members.
 The explanation to this can be provided by considering that with odd teams,
 at least a robot is assigned to explore the corridor located under the
 initial location.
 While, when the team is even, all the robots are assigned to frontiers
 on the left, making them take the long way to reach the lower section of
 the environment.
 Patterns can hardly be found and no mechanism outperforms the other constantly.
 The mechanism based on the barycenter performs well in general, but, except
 for the team composed of ten robots, there is always another mechanism
 which takes less time.
 Mechanisms employing closeness provide very good performance in general,
 particularly the one on the topological graph.
 As the team size increases, methods based on betweenness tend to perform
 better.
 This trend reminds the one on the previous environment.

The sixth environment is the largest environment.
 Even in this case, no mechanism outperforms the other in all the cases
 and similarly to the first and the forth, the mechanism based on the barycenter
 performs worse than at least another mechanism.
 Except for the team composed of eight robots, with teams of at least six
 robots, the mechanism computing the closeness for the topological graph
 provides consistently good performance, reaching the best with teams of
 more than nine members.
 In this environment, it is shown the opposite trend shown of the two previous
 environments.
 Mechanisms based on closeness tend to outperform the ones based on betweenness
 on the same type of graph for small teams.
 Once the team size reaches a certain value, this trend inverts, making
 mechanisms based on betweenness preferable.

As pointed out, this inversion in the trend is recurrent in the last three
 environments.
 They have in common the classification both as large and highly parallelizable
 environments.
 While they differ for the openness, being the environment 4 classified
 as open, and the environments 5 and 6 as cluttered.
 Thus, mechanisms based on closeness being preferable with small teams and
 the ones based on betweenness providing better performance with big teams
 is a trend that might be related to some features of the environment.
 To confirm this, it holds both for the visibility graph and the topological
 graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first conclusion which can be get from these plots is that each implemented
 mechanism seems to provide almost similar performance with respect to all
 the others.
 The mechanism based on barycenter, which is the benchmark one, is usually
 one of the best, in particular in the second environment.

Proactive reserve

Same as what done for the proactive buddy, the performance of the different
 version of the proactive reserve are here shown, starting at first, with
 the number of steps taken to complete the exploration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first environment is the small office-like.
 The plateau noticed before is present also there, being even more evident
 for the team with more than nine robots.
 The benchmark mechanism tend to be one of the best for almost every team
 size, with the only exception for the team with six agents.
 The monotonically decreasing trend identified previously for the proactive
 buddy based on the betweenness of the topological graph is here verifiable
 for the mechanism based on the closeness of the same kind of graph.

The second environment seems to be affected more than previously by the
 variations in the proactivity function.
 Both the mechanisms based on the visibility graph seem to reach a plateau
 after the team is composed of more than eight robots.
 It is also interesting to notice the high variability shown by the mechanism
 based on the closeness of the topological graph.

The third environment is explored faster as the team size increases, and
 this is true for almost all the mechanisms.
 The mechanism based on the barycenter is the fastest with big teams of
 ten and eleven robots.
 From teams of medium size, from six to nine agents, the mechanism exploiting
 the betweenness of the topological graph performs generally better.
 Moreover, topological graph-based mechanisms tend to outperform constantly
 the mechanism based on the betweenness of the visibility graph.
 Same holds with the one based on the closeness of the visibility graph,
 while in some cases topological graph-based mechanisms go even with it.

The forth environment is characterized by all the mechanisms showing little
 variations one from another.
 There are some exceptions where, for a certain team size, a mechanism performs
 a lot worse than all the others.
 An example of this is for the team of eleven robots, where the number of
 steps taken by the two topological graph-based mechanisms differ of the
 25%.
 Another pattern which can be highlighted is that mechanisms based on betweennes
s tend to perform even or better than the ones based on the closeness for
 the same kind of graph.

In the fifth environment, the mechanism based on the barycenter tend not
 to be a good choice for almost every team size.
 Even in the cases where the number of steps is the lowest, there is another
 mechanism performing similarly.
 Another factor to point out is that differently from the proactive buddy,
 there is no difference whether the team is composed of an even or odd number
 of agents.
 Another thing to notice is that for the visibility graph-based mechanisms,
 the one exploiting betweenness usually performs better than the one using
 closeness.
 This holds except for the team of eight robots, where the closeness one
 performs a lot better, and for teams of six and nine robots, where the
 difference is negligible.

In the sixth environment, similarly to the fourth, the trend for all the
 mechanisms tend to be monotonically decreasing, as more robots compose
 the team.
 The mechanism based on barycenter provides very good results, even if these
 are almost always equal to or worse than the ones obtained by the exploitation
 of the closeness for the topological graph.
 This holds always except for the case of the team with eleven robots, where
 the steps taken to explore by all the graph-based mechanisms increase with
 respect to the team of ten robots, while they decrease a little in the
 case of the mechanism based on the barycenter.
 From teams to six robots to eleven, topological graph-based mechanisms
 outperform the visibility graph-based ones.
