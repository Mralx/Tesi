\begin_layout Section
Exploration problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exploration problem can be defined as the problem of mapping an unknown
 environment by means of a team of robots.
 Thus, the objective is the production of a map of the environment but this
 introduces further problems, concerning for example the localization of
 each robot dealing with the various sources of uncertainty, how to distribute
 the team and how to coordinate them.
 These are three of the main aspects considered in the development of a
 solution to this problem, providing the major impact on performances.
 To compare different approaches the main metric used is the time taken
 by the exploration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, and also the distance traveled by the robots is sometimes considered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A formal definition of the 
\emph on
exploration problem
\emph default
, in the following abbreviated as 
\emph on
EP
\emph default
,
\emph on
 
\emph default
can be provided through a 4-ple 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle A,E,P_{0},T\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 where: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the set of robots used for the exploration;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the environment to explore;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $P_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of the initial poses of the team;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the termination criterion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This four elements characterize the instance of EP addressed, while the
 solution of the same consists in producing a map 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 of the environment 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 The map 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 consists in a 2D occupancy grid representing the areas of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 The center of each cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is characterized by its coordinates in the environment, provided as a vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{c},y_{c})$
\end_inset

.
 Each cell contains a variable, whose value tells if that cell is clear,
 occupied by an obstacle or still unknown.
 Clearly, the first two values refer only to already explored cells, while
 the third refers to those cells which are still not scanned by any robot
 of the team.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiments presented in this work are run on MRESim, a 2D simulator
 aimed at testing multi-robot exploration scenarios 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mresim"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, it allows to create an instance of 
\emph on
EP 
\emph default
through a configuration file which provides the robots in the team, their
 initial poses and a PNG image providing the map of the environment to explore.
 The termination criterion used is the percentage of explored area and it
 can be modified by varying a variable in the code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following sections describe the settings for the experiments, focusing
 at first on the environment and the agents modeling, then moving the attention
 to the exploration strategy and the coordination mechanisms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Localization and mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of mapping an unknown environment and simultaneously localize
 the robot on the partial map built is one of the fundamental problems of
 robotics, called 
\emph on
SLAM problem,
\emph default
 from 
\emph on
Simultaneous Localization And Mapping.
 
\emph default
The robot knows its initial pose and as it moves, the uncertainty about
 its motion increases, due to uncertainty in the odometry.
 For this reason it becomes necessary to localize it on the map, even a
 partial one.
 A formal description of it, as provided in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "handbook of robotics"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, is suitably done in a probabilistic framework and distinguishes two versions,
 the 
\emph on
online 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
full
\emph default
 
\emph on
SLAM problem
\emph default
.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{T},U_{T}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{T}$
\end_inset

 be three statistical variables representing respectively the sequence of
 locations assumed by the robot, i.e.
 the 
\emph on
path
\emph default
, the sequence of odometry measurements and the sequence of measurements
 provided by the sensors.
 Let also 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 be the true map of the environment.
 The 
\emph on
full SLAM problem 
\emph default
is then defined as the problem of estimating the posterior probability of
 the map together with the whole path traveled by the robot, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(X_{T},m|Z_{T},U_{T}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\emph on
online SLAM problem 
\emph default
aims at estimating the posterior of the actual location of the robot, rather
 than the whole path, together with the map.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x_{T},m|Z_{T},U_{T}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens in practice is that as the robot moves in the unknown environment,
 it perceives the surroundings through its sensors, has an estimate of its
 odometry measures and these are used to reduce the uncertainty both about
 the map built and the location of, or the path followed by, the robot,
 depending on the version of the SLAM algorithm implemented.
 As the exploration goes on, the partial map approaches to a complete map
 of the environment and it is also possible to get rid of the noise in the
 measurements.
 The model for the map can be both topological 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "graph-based slam"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or metric 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "40"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, in particular in this work the representation provided is metric, consisting
 in an occupancy grid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work considers only indoor environments.
 Reasons behind this restriction are related to the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cattaneo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, of which this thesis is an extension, in order to provide a comparison
 against the same type of environments.
 However, this focus is justified by the application contexts, being the
 exploration of indoor environments more common with respect to outdoor
 ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The representation of the map provided by the SLAM algorithm used in this
 work is a two-dimensional occupancy grid.
 Moreover, being applied to a multi-robot scenario, comes out the difficulty
 of merging the maps computed by solving the SLAM problem for each agent.
 The solution to this is a centralized approach by means of a base station,
 which aim is to collect all the individual local maps and combine them
 into a single global map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cattaneo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the environment are classified according to some features characterizing
 them.
 In particular, the aspects considered are the dimension, the openness,
 and the parallelizability.
 The first two are easy to formally define.
 For the third one, a formal definition can hardly be provided being influenced
 by many factors.
 To make the definitions more readable, recalling that 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 denotes the map of the environment modeled as an occupancy grid, let 
\begin_inset Formula $S:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 be an auxiliary function which takes as input a cell of the map and provides
 its area.
 The features considered can be defined in the following way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dimension: the amount of free area in the map.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $D(M)=\sum_{i}S(f_{i})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}$
\end_inset

 being a clear cell.
 The size of the environment clearly affects the average time taken by robots
 to explore it.
 Smaller the environment, lower the amount of resources needed to efficiently
 map it.
 From this, the distinction into small (S) and large (L) environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Openness: the property of an environment to be composed of large open spaces
 (O) rather than cluttered ones (C).
 It is related to obstacle density, so to the probability of a randomly
 picked cell to be occupied by an obstacle.
 This is formally defined in a probabilistic framework as 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(M\right)=\frac{\sum_{i}S(o_{i})}{\sum_{j}S(c_{j})}$
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $o_{i}$
\end_inset

 is an occupied cell and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a generic cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Parallelizability: the property of an environment to enforce the spreading
 of the robots during the exploration.
 A formal definition to this is hard to provide, but it can be informally
 presented considering that if the environment allows the team to spread,
 it is highly parallelizable (HP).
 Otherwise, if the robots are forced to stick together, it is lightly paralleliz
able (LP).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make these distinctions clearer, it is worth looking at some of the environme
nts used in this work and at how they are classified on these features.
 In Figure 1, two very different environments are presented.

Example of two different environments
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The environment in Figure 1.a is composed by a series of large corridors,
 ending in some rooms.
 This is classified as S-O-LP, because its dimension is small and the areas
 of which is composed are mainly open ones, not cluttered rooms.
 The lightly parallelizability comes out from its configuration, where the
 robots follow almost similar paths, forced by the long corridors and they
 are not allowed to spread into it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second one (Figure 1.b) is likely to be the map of an office.
 It is composed by a lot of rooms, corridors and spaces with different dimension
s.
 It is classified as L-C-HP because the amount of free area is really large
 and is mainly composed of rooms and limited spaces.
 For the configuration of the corridors, the robots tend to spread in different
 directions, without sticking one another.
 For this reason, the environment is classified as highly parallelizable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In MRESim, an agent is characterized through:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a number and an ID to uniquely identify it;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
its pose, expressed by a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\left[x,y,\phi\right]$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 are the coordinates of the grid cells occupied by the robot and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is its orientation;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the sensing range, set to the default value;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the communication range, assumed to be infinite;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the battery life, assumed to be infinite as well;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
its type, it can be the base station, a relay or an explorer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The communication range and the battery life are assumed to be infinite
 because the focus of this work is on the results provided by the use of
 different coordination mechanisms.
 In this way is possible to simplify the mechanisms not to consider scenarios
 in which the robot runs out of fuel or they are unable to communicate,
 even if these situations are of particular interest in a more realistic
 context and object of study as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "6"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "58"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stated above, the type of the robot, not to be confused with its role,
 can be: base station, relay or explorer.
 The 
\emph on
relay
\emph default
 type is never used in the simulation performed for this work, being useful
 in cases in which communication between a robot and the base station is
 not possible.
 Indeed, each team used is composed by one base station and from two to
 eleven explorers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
base station
\emph default
 is the central coordinator of the team, and stores the global map computed
 by merging the partial maps provided by the agents.
 It is configured similarly to other agents but its pose is fixed to the
 initial one.
 It is important for the purpose of exploration because allows agents to
 coordinate by means of a centralized unit, rather than a decentralized
 approach, which would make the merging of the map way more difficult.
 An example of this is in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "11"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, where only as soon as two robots meet, they are able to merge their map
 and then proceed with the exploration based on this updated one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
explorer 
\emph default
is the main kind of agents employed, being the one which moves in the environmen
t to map it.
 Apart from the configuration parameters presented above, it is also characteriz
ed by a finite value of speed.
 They are equipped with a laser sensor allowing them to scan a semicircle
 of radius fixed to the sensing range in front of them.
 The value for the sensing range is specified in the configuration file.
 As an explorer perceives previously unknown cells with the laser beam,
 communicates the measurements to the base station which merges them with
 the stored map and updates it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Exploration strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frontier-based exploration presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "61"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is applied to identify the candidate locations to explore.
 A frontier is the boundary region between known and unknown space and by
 moving towards frontiers, this boundary is pushed accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As highlighted in the previous section, the model for the map is an occupancy
 grid.
 Each robot has its own local map, updated through the sensor measurements,
 and merged at the base station to provide a global map, which is the one
 used in the frontiers identification phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their position is identified by at first drawing the polygon of the known
 space.
 Each side of this polygon which separates the known area from the unknown
 one is suitable to provide frontiers.
 If the area of this suitable locations is higher than a certain threshold,
 then the cell in the middle is considered as a possible navigation goal.
 There is also the possibility that the area is too large, in which case
 it is split into more than one frontier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Coordination mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A coordination mechanism is the algorithm providing the allocation of robots
 to the possible navigation goals computed by the exploration strategy.
 Together with the SLAM and the exploration strategy, this completes the
 view on the settings needed for the exploration.
 In fact, the process of exploring an unknown environment starts with the
 robots scanning an area through the sensors and this data, together with
 the initial location, are used as input to the SLAM algorithm, which provides
 a partial raw map as output.
 This is given to the exploration strategy that, as stated above, performs
 a discretization of the polygon surrounding the known area and computes
 the frontiers, excluding the ones too small.
 At this point, the coordination mechanism is applied to find out an allocation
 of robots to frontiers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The different coordination mechanisms are the main focus of this work.
 In the following are presented both the base mechanisms from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and their extensions provided by

\begin_layout Subsection
Base mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

, three mechanisms are presented, namely 
\emph on
reserve, buddy system 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
divide and conquer.

\emph default
 They are all focused on how 
\emph on
proactive 
\emph default
are the team members not strictly needed for the exploration.
 The team can be separated in two sub-teams, the 
\emph on
active 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
idle set
\emph default
,
\emph on
 
\emph default
with the first one composed by the robots which goal is to explore one of
 the frontiers detected, the second one is made up by the remaining robots.
 An example is useful to clarify this distinction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that at the beginning of the exploration, the sensed environment
 provides only two frontiers (may add a figure) and the team is composed
 by four robots.
 The size of the team is greater than the number of frontiers, thus only
 two robots are needed to explore them.
 Therefore, they compose the active set and the remaining two robots form
 the idle set.
 The policy for the active set is the same for all the mechanisms, to explore
 the closest frontier.
 The differences come out dealing with the idle set, in fact the way in
 which robots are proactively moved allows to distinguish among each method.
 Moreover, this theme of a proactive use of the idle set is the leitmotiv
 linking the work started in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "29"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and extended both by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cattaneo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reserve is the less proactive mechanism because as the name implies, the
 idle set is left as a reserve at the initial location.
 As the exploration starts and the first frontiers are detected, the robots
 are split into the active set and the idle set, in a similar way to the
 example provided before.
 Then, the robots in the active set move towards their navigation goal and
 the ones in the idle set remain still in their initial position.
 As the exploration goes on and new frontiers are found, their number may
 be higher than the size of the active set, making some or all the robots
 from the idle set needed, which are then turned into active and assigned
 to a target location.
 Once the idle set is empty and all the robots are active, the exploration
 proceeds in an uncoordinated way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Divide and conquer is the most proactive mechanism presented in that work
 because the idle set moves together with the active set.
 At the beginning of the exploration, active agents are assigned to the
 frontiers, and the idle set is split in several subsets, one for each active
 agent.
 For example, assume that at the beginning, only a frontier is found.
 Then, an agent is marked as 
\emph on
leader 
\emph default
and assigned to explore it.
 The other robots follow it as it moves towards its navigation goal, until
 at least another frontier is detected.
 For the sake of the example, assume that at this point there are two frontiers.
 In this case, a robot from the idle set is turned into active and marked
 as leader.
 The idle set is split in two: one half follows the first leader, the other
 half follows the other one.
 This goes on until the idle set is empty, after which the exploration proceeds
 in an uncoordinated way.
 Differently from the reserve mechanism, this approach allows to have robots
 from the idle set nearer to the navigation goal to which they are going
 to be assigned.
 In this sense, the idle team members are considered to be more proactive
 with respect to reserve, where waiting at the initial location makes the
 distance between the robot turned into active and the navigation goal higher.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buddy system is considered to be halfway between the two for what concerns
 proactivity of the agents.
 This comes clearer by looking at how the system handles the idle set.
 As soon as robots are deployed on the environment, couples are formed,
 composed by a robot marked as 
\emph on
leader
\emph default
 and another marked as 
\emph on
follower
\emph default
, each one is the 
\emph on
buddy
\emph default
 of the other.
 Once frontiers are identified, the minimum number of leader agents is turned
 into active and assigned to them.
 Each follower follows its own leader towards this task.
 The other couples remain still at the initial location, similarly to the
 idle set in the reserve mechanism.
 When a branching point is met, that is a point where there are two or more
 frontiers, the couple is split and the leader is assigned to a frontier,
 while the follower to the other one.
 Here the analogy with the divide and conquer mechanism can be seen.
 If a robot split from its buddy finds another branching point, a couple
 from the idle set is called and assigned to one of the two frontiers, while
 the single robot goes towards the other.
 This clarifies why the buddy system can be seen as a mix of the reserve
 mechanism and the divide and conquer.
 It both keeps the idle set waiting at the initial location for the moment
 in which it is needed, as reserve, and each leader goes with a follower
 from which splits when a branching point is met, similarly to the divide
 and conquer.
 In this way, when a follower is turned into active, it is already pretty
 near to its goal, providing a similar advantage of divide and conquer,
 without the disadvantage of having the whole team moving close.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Proactive mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cattaneo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, three modifications for the mechanisms presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "29"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are provided.
 As stated previously, they focus on enhancing how proactive is the idle
 set.
 The way in which this is done is pretty straightforward for what concerns
 reserve and buddy system, while it is a little more tricky for divide and
 conquer.
 The mechanisms proposed are named 
\emph on
proactive reserve, proactive buddy system 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
side follower.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main problem with reserve mechanism is that once a robot from the idle
 set is turned into active, it has to move from the initial location to
 its goal.
 The distance it has to travel may be lower if the robot is moved in a nearer
 position while it is still idle.
 This is exactly what this modified mechanism tries to do by moving the
 idle robots to the barycenter of the active robots positions.
 In this way, they are likely to be nearer to the newly detected frontiers
 which have to be explored.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The buddy system faces a similar problem to reserve mechanism, the robots
 in the idle set wait to be turned into active at the initial location.
 Thus, the proactive version of the buddy system moves the idle couples
 at the barycenter of the active agents locations, for the same reason explained
 above concerning the proactive reserve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of divide and conquer is different, being linked with the interferen
ce caused by moving the whole team of robots together.
 Therefore, the team of robots is split into groups of three at the beginning
 of the exploration and roles are assigned to them.
 The central robot is the leader, the right one is the right follower and
 the left one is the left follower.
 This roles are statically determined and never modified.
 Moreover, they affect the assignment of frontiers to the group members,
 being the frontier along the direction of the movement assigned to the
 leader, the ones on its right assigned to the right follower and the ones
 on the left to the left follower symmetrically.
 In this way, there is a trade-off between the interference caused by the
 number of robots moving together and the distance from the frontiers, reducing
 the first one without affecting too much the second one.
