\begin_layout Title
Modeling and evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous chapter, the coordination mechanisms developed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cattaneo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 have been presented, giving particular attention to the contribution provided
 by proactivity.
 Concerning buddy system and reserve, their proactive versions move the
 idle set at the barycenter of the positions of the active agents.
 This ensures good results when compared with the base method, in particular
 for proactive reserve.
 However, the location for the idle set is computed naively and might be
 exploiting only a part of the information available at the moment related
 to the structure of the environment.
 For example, the barycenter of the positions of the active robots may fall
 into a small room, from which a robot in the idle set would have to get
 off once turned into active, making the move into the room almost useless.
 On the contrary, we are more interested in moving the robots in the idle
 set towards positions providing a good starting point for them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To include the structure of the environment directly into the coordination
 mechanism, graphs are considered.
 They provide a representation of the free space and computing some suitable
 metrics, called centrality metrics, it is possible to find out a subset
 of nodes more influential on connectivity between spaces.
 In this way, the proactivity location, i.e., the location where the idle
 set is proactively moved, is a central point of the environment.
 The concept of centrality varies accordingly to the centrality metric used
 to compute such subset of nodes.
 In the following, the graphs and the centrality metrics used in this work
 will be presented and described in-depth.
 The last section is dedicated to providing an overview of the criteria
 used to evaluate the different coordination mechanisms tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of graphs allows including a topological component in the coordination,
 which is done employing an embedded graph.
 A graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 embedded to a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is a representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 such that points of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and arcs in it are associated with vertices and edges of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 This concept is applied by creating a graph 
\begin_inset Formula $\varUpsilon$
\end_inset

 embedded on the map 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and then through the measures of the centrality of a node, nodes are ranked
 based on their values for the two centrality measures used in this work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of an embedded graph is independent of the actual implementation
 of it and this leaves the freedom to adapt the correspondence points-nodes
 and arcs-edges on the needs.
 Based on this, two different types of graphs are defined in the next sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These graphs differ strongly on how they are defined and how they model
 the environment.
 The first one is more focused on the topological properties of the environment,
 nodes and edges are computed based on the structure of the known free space.
 The model it provides is not strictly affected by team-dependent factors
 like agents distribution or team size, being built only considering the
 connectivity properties of the map.
 On the contrary, the second kind of graph defined below is built according
 to the positions of the agents moving in the environment.
 In this way, it includes information related to the disposition of the
 agents and the path followed.
 Moreover, it is also indirectly affected by the structure of the environment,
 being the agents only capable of moving in the free space, the routes they
 travel outline the connectivity among the different spaces.
 In the following, how frontiers are introduced into the graph building
 process is also explained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following sections explain in detail how the two types of graphs are
 built during the exploration process, starting with the topological graph
 and then moving on to the visibility one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Topological graph
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From now on, as 
\emph on
topological graph
\emph default
 will be identified a graph isomorphic to the graph used by the simulator
 to compute the path followed by the agents during the exploration.
 As presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mresim"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the construction of this one is based on the structure of the occupancy
 grid known up to that moment, in which the skeleton of the free space is
 found by performing thinning.
 A discretization is then applied to the skeleton to find the set of nodes
 composing the graph and nodes linked by the skeleton are also connected
 by an edge, weighted according to the distance between the nodes.
 This process is sufficient to provide a simple topological graph embedded
 on the map of the environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On one side, the use of this graph is backed up by the implementation of
 the navigation system, because it is computed just once for both the applicatio
ns and in this way it does not introduce further costs in the building and
 the update.
 On the other side, it is pretty limited in its representation.
 It suffices to provide a topological view of the environment, but it is
 hard to extend with elements like frontier nodes or information about the
 location of the robots.
 Two aspects that characterize the second kind of graph tested, the visibility
 graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 1.a, the topological graph of the environment presented in the
 previous chapter is shown.
 This one has been produced by applying the building procedure on the whole
 map of the environment when it has been completely mapped.
 This has been considered to show more clearly the properties of this graph.
 The disposition of the nodes is almost uniform and this can be particularly
 noticed by looking at their distribution in the lateral rooms.
 Being these spaces almost equal in structure, nodes are placed with the
 same pattern.
 Moreover, the distance among nodes tends to be almost the same on the entire
 map, with a slight reduction at the conjunctions.
 This almost uniform distribution highlights strongly the difference in
 structure with the visibility graph, shown in Figure 1.b, where nodes are
 provided with varying concentrations among the various spaces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Visibility graph 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
visibility graph 
\emph default
as defined in this work consists of a graph built on the notion of visibility,
 rather than the navigability from node to node.
 It is composed of two different types of nodes, the 
\emph on
pose nodes,
\emph default
 and the 
\emph on
frontier nodes
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first kind is the one composing the vast majority of the graph and each
 node has an historical meaning, being a pose assumed by an active robot
 during the exploration.
 As active agents proceed in their mapping task, their locations are stored
 as nodes every time a re-plan for one of them or a new location for the
 robots in the idle set is needed.
 These two events happen quite frequently in the initial part of the exploration
, and thus they trigger the graph building function enough times.
 However, the frequency with which this is done is variable, for this reason,
 the distribution of the nodes might be loose in some spaces and more tight
 in others.
 This allows keeping the number of nodes in the graph reduced with respect
 to the case in which every time an active agent moves, its pose is used
 to set up a pose node.
 Nevertheless, as long as connectivity is ensured, the effect on the information
 obtainable by the graph is almost the same and by keeping the size of the
 graph reduced, the complexity of computing centrality measures remains
 manageable.
 To enforce this aspect, the location of an active agent is added as a pose
 node as long as there are no other pose nodes within a certain radius.
 Once a pose node is added to the graph, it is fixed and never modified
 as the exploration goes on.
 The motion of agents in the idle set is excluded to avoid an excessive
 concentration of nodes in some crucial areas, which would negatively affect
 the computation of centrality measures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second kind of node is frontier nodes.
 As the name suggests, they allow to include the frontiers computed by the
 exploration strategy into the graph.
 This is a fundamental characterization of this graph in the distinction
 from the topological one.
 At each step in which the list of frontiers is updated, the same is done
 for the list of frontier nodes: the old ones which have been explored are
 removed and the new ones are added, making this type of nodes variable
 in time differently from pose nodes which are fixed once they are put in
 the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An edge models the notion of visibility: two nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 are linked by an edge if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

is within the sensing range of a robot placed in 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 and there are no obstacles along the straight line connecting them.
 This relation holds in both the directions, thus the visibility graph is
 an undirected graph by construction, same as the topological one.
 Edges are also characterized by a weight equal to the distance between
 the nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1.b shows the visibility graph built by a team of robots during the
 exploration.
 Accordingly to what stated previously, the distribution of nodes depends
 strongly on the path followed by the robots and on the frequency with which
 the graph is updated.
 The structural differences with the topological graph in Figure 1.a are
 clean just by looking at the two figures and all relate to the distribution
 of nodes, being widely less uniform.
 Frontier nodes, here painted in red, are also a discriminating factor between
 the two.

\begin_layout Section
Centrality measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Centrality measures have been exploited widely in the literature, especially
 in fields related to social networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, power grids

 and computer virus spreading

\end_inset

.
 This is possible since centrality measures are applicable as long as the
 system is modeled by means of a graph and they provide a ranking of the
 nodes according to the metric applied.
 In fact, different metrics may provide different rankings, depending on
 the network topology, because of the mismatching concept of central node.
 An example of this is provided by the kite graph 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kite graph"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It is a simple graph composed of 10 nodes and 18 edges and it is depicted
 in Figure 2.
 The particularity of it is to be the smallest possible graph for which
 the nodes having the highest values of the three most basic centrality
 measures, namely degree, closeness, and betweenness, are all different.

\begin_layout Standard
To the author's knowledge, there are no previous works trying to apply the
 use of centrality measures to enhance the coordination of a team of robots
 and due to the variability depending on the centrality measure used, in
 this work both closeness and betweenness have been tested.
 In the following sections, they are formally introduced with the reasons
 for their use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Closeness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The closeness centrality of a node is defined as the reciprocal of the sum
 of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all the other
 nodes in the graph 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "closeness originale"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This definition is strongly dependent on the number of nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 in the graph, thus closeness is usually normalized by dividing for 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

.
 In this way, closeness can be defined as the reciprocal of the average
 distance between the node and all the other nodes and allows to compare
 its value for graphs of different sizes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formally, let 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 be nodes of the graph, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 be a real-valued function which provides the length of the shortest path
 connecting two nodes, then the normalized closeness value 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(x\right)=\frac{N-1}{\sum_{y\neq x}d\left(x,y\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 the total number of nodes in the graph, as defined above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original formulation of closeness centrality considers only unweighted
 graphs, but it has been extended to be applied also to weighted ones.
 The formal definition is the same assuming an appropriate modification
 in the implementation of the distance function 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, in an unweighted graph, it simply has to count the number of edges
 along the shortest path linking the two nodes in input, while on a weighted
 graph the cost of traversing an edge is proportional to its weight and
 thus it has to be included accordingly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "weighted closeness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the latter case, the distance function 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(x,y\right)=\sum_{e\in E}w\left(e\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 are nodes of the graph, 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the set of edges of the graph composing the shortest path from 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is a real-valued function returning the weight of the edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closeness tends to consider central nodes the ones in which distance from
 all the other nodes is lower on average.
 Therefore, going back to an exploration context, placing an agent in the
 location corresponding to the highest closeness node makes it possible
 to reach an assigned position, not known before, in an expected time lower
 than any other starting location with a lower closeness.
 This reasoning has been applied to the idle set, which placed in the node
 with the highest closeness is likely to already be in a good spot when
 turned into active.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 3 an example of the distribution of high closeness nodes is shown
 for each kind of graph.
 For the sake of the example, as high closeness nodes are considered nodes
 with a value of closeness higher than the 75% of the max value.
 It is interesting to point out how these nodes are distributed mostly on
 one corner of the central space for the topological graph, while they wrap
 the central obstacle in the visibility case.
 Despite the marked differences in their structures and the number and dispositi
on of high closeness nodes, it is remarkable that the distance among the
 highest closeness nodes is really low.

 of the total number of shortest paths between other nodes passes through

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 be three nodes in a connected graph, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{st}$
\end_inset

 be the total number of shortest paths connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $t$

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

where the sum is performed over each pair of nodes in the graph.
 The graph needs to be connected, otherwise, each 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{st}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is a disconnected node would result in a division by zero.
 However, this is always granted in the context of this work because of
 the way in which graphs are built.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Betweenness followed an evolution similar to the one of closeness, being
 at first defined on unweighted graphs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "closeness originale"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and then extended to the case of weighted ones 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "weighted closeness"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the case of weighted graphs, weights impact how shortest paths are computed,
 making necessary the use of algorithms like Dijkstra's or Breadth-First
 Search to deal with them.
 Once the shortest paths are provided, the algorithm to compute the betweenness
 is the same.
 Similarly to closeness, where the introduction of weights on the edges
 only affects the computation of the distances between nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea behind this metric is to assign higher importance to the nodes
 which are along more shortest paths linking couples of other nodes.
 In different works about social networks analysis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "closeness originale"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, betweenness is used to find out which are the nodes having more control
 over the information flow.
 Nodes with a high value of betweenness are along more shortest paths, thus
 more information goes through them and an eventual disconnection may cause
 loss of information or a separation of the graph into two sub-graphs.
 However, a node of this kind is likely to be fundamental for what concerns
 the connectivity of the graph, differently from a node with low betweenness.
 According to this, the approach based on betweenness has been conceived.
 Being interested in an effective positioning of the idle set, a location
 with a high value of betweenness is an ideal candidate because it guarantees
 to be a crucial point for the connectivity of the environment and when
 the idle set is turned into active, it is likely to be in a good position
 to navigate towards the assigned frontier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 4, the nodes with high betweenness are plotted over the representation
 of the graphs provided before.
 The first thing that catches the eye is the difference in the number of
 this kind of nodes between the topological and the visibility graphs, being
 a lot more in the first one.
 This can be justified by considering the reduced size of the graph in that
 case, which makes every node on more shortest paths, thus with a higher
 value of betweenness.
 Also for this metric holds what stated previously about the highest closeness
 node.
 Despite the different structures of the two graphs and the even more marked
 difference in the distribution of high betweenness nodes, the highest values
 of the metric are measured in two extremely near locations.
 This enforces the idea that these metrics can characterize the environment
 mapped and by an analysis of them, it might be even possible to discriminate
 among different types of it.

Comparative metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The different methods proposed are compared based both on practical measures,
 as the time taken to fulfill the termination criterion and the distance
 traveled by the robots, and on theory-based measures, namely interference
 among robots and their availability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of time and distance traveled as comparison metrics is intuitive
 if looking at some of the application contexts.
 Teams of robots are often used in search and rescue scenarios, where the
 time needed to complete the exploration is a fundamental aspect to take
 into account.
 Thus, a faster approach is overall preferable to a slower one in such a
 scenario.
 The distance traveled is a less important factor in discriminating among
 different mechanisms, but it may provide an interesting and more complete
 overview of an approach compared to others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the simulations run in this work, the termination criterion used is the
 exploration of the 95% of the environment.
 At the end of each run, the number of discrete time steps taken and the
 average distance traveled by the robots are stored and then compared during
 the analysis of the results.
 The decision of considering the number of time steps rather than the time
 taken by the exploration has been carried on to exclude machine-dependent
 aspects from the results.
 Some of the mechanisms implemented are way more computationally intensive
 than the ones based on the barycenter computation, and comparing their
 results on the effective time taken would have been faked by the computing
 capability of the machine running simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two metrics have been considered sufficient to characterize from a
 practical point of view each mechanism analyzed.
 Nevertheless, two further measures are used to examine the mechanisms,
 which are named interference and availability.
 They are at first introduced in

 and formalized in

\begin_layout Subsection
Interference 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interference quantifies the average distance held by agents during the explorati
on and the higher the distance, the lower the value.
 A high value of interference is desirable because as the average distance
 among robots increases, it reduces the possibility of incidents and the
 complexity in the management of the system.
 Moreover, it is also an indirect measure of how parallel the exploration
 is being carried on because it increases as the robots are spread on the
 environment.
 According to this, the value of interference for a particular coordination
 mechanism can provide useful information about the amount of parallelizability
 exploited as compared to other mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of interference 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 for an agent 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is computed at each step 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 of the exploration by calculating the average distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and all the other agents 
\begin_inset Formula $a'$
\end_inset

 in the team 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, thus it can be formally written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{t}\left(a\right)=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{a'\in A|a'\neq a}d\left(P_{t}\left(a\right),P_{t}\left(a'\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the size of the team, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a function providing the position of an agent at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the function that computes the distance between two positions of the
 environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This definition only relates to one agent at a particular instant of the
 exploration.
 To completely characterize the value of interference for the whole exploration,
 it needs to be at first generalized over the set of agents composing the
 team and then over the entire time needed to complete the exploration.
 In this way, its value computed for a specific coordination mechanism is
 comparable with the ones provided by other mechanisms over the same exploration
 problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first generalization consists in extending the definition of interference
 to all the robots in the team, rather than considering only a single robot,
 and this is simply done by averaging the values of interference of each
 agent:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{t}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a\in A}\lambda_{t}\left(a\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, it is possible to integrate this expression over the entire
 time taken by the exploration, which is considered to take values in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\ldots,t_{T}\right]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{T}$
\end_inset

 being the time step of the fulfillment of the termination criterion 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The definition of the interference for the coordination mechanism applied
 to a specific instance of the exploration problem considered is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\frac{1}{t_{T}+1}\sum_{t=0}^{t_{T}}\lambda_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This states that the interference for the whole exploration can be computed
 by averaging over the total time taken the values of interference for the
 team.
 In this way, the value of interference obtained can be exploited to compare
 different coordination mechanisms, avoiding that differences in the duration
 of the exploration impact on this measure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Availability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Availability is a measure of the distance between an agent and its assigned
 location.
 It can be formally defined at first for a single agent 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in a certain time step 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha_{t}\left(a\right)=d\left(P_{t}\left(a\right),G_{t}\left(a\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the symbol used for the availability and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a function returning the location of the frontier assigned to the agent
 in input.
 The two auxiliary functions 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 are the same presented in the previous section to define the interference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to what done for the interference, this definition can be generalized
 to the whole team and the whole exploration.
 Following similar reasoning and with the same meaning of the symbols, the
 availability for the whole team at a certain instant 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 of the exploration is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha_{t}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a\in A}\alpha_{t}\left(a\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
recalling that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the set of agents composing the team and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is its cardinality.
 Averaging this result over the whole exploration time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{T}$
\end_inset

 defines availability for a coordination mechanism applied to a specific
 instance of the exploration problem, thus it turns out to be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha=\frac{1}{t_{T}+1}\sum_{t=0}^{t_{T}}\alpha_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This value of the availability is independent of the time taken to meet
 the termination criterion and therefore, allows a comparison among different
 coordination mechanisms, without being affected by their respective performance
 in terms of time.
 It is important to highlight how availability has the opposite trend of
 interference.
 Indeed, a mechanism with low availability assigns robots to locations near
 their positions, which makes the agents update the environment more frequently
 than a scenario in which robots have to travel a long distance before scanning
 unknown portions of it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This metric has a two-fold interpretation.
 From one side, it shows whether a mechanism assigns robots to far or close
 targets.
 On the other side, it can provide insights on the effectiveness of the
 proactivity when comparing two mechanisms which differ only in this aspect.
 This, in particular, is the setting of this thesis.
 The differences of the mechanisms analyzed concerns only the proactive
 allocation of the idle set, and thus a mechanism that has a lower value
 of availability is likely to place this set of robots in a position nearer
 to the frontiers.
 Strong evidence of this relation between proactivity and availability is
 provided by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cattaneo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in the comparison between reserve and proactive reserve, where by moving
 the idle set towards the barycenter of locations of the active agents,
 the latter method ensures agents to travel a shorter distance once turned
 into active with respect to the former one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth to point out also that the absolute value of both this metric
 and the interference is highly affected by the particular configuration
 of the environment explored and by the team size, for this reason, comparisons
 among mechanisms based on them do make sense only if done on the same instance
 of exploration problem.
