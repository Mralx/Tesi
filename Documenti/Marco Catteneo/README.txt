This folder contains 4 sub-folders:
-DATA_ANALYSIS:
containing the log data, the scripts to analyze the log data and the 
diagrams obtained.

-DOCUMENTS
contianing the text of the thesis and the slide presentation, both in 
PDF format.

-MRE_SIM: 
containing the code of the whole MRESim software, comprehensive of the 
original mechanisms proposed.

-PAPERS: 
containing a collection of state-of-the art papers on different
topics.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


For a proper read, I suggest to start by reading the text of the thesis 
along with the literature on which it is based. Only in a second phase, 
the MRESim code and the deriving data analysis should be explored.
